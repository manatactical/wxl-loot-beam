// The beacon does not use wxl::game::gfx's flush: that one blends source-over, which makes a light
// shaft read as a coloured pane and cannot make a gradient cheaper than one colour per triangle. This
// is a small, self-contained triangle queue drawn additively (source alpha added to the frame, never
// dimming what is behind it) with a colour on every vertex, so the GPU interpolates the falloffs and a
// handful of quads read as a soft volume. It reads the same scene matrices the world was drawn with,
// so it lands where its world coordinates say.
